    abstract = {The GNU Autotools make it easy for developers to create software that is portable across many UNIX-like operating sy
stems. Thousands of open source software packages use the Autotools, but the learning curve is unfortunately steep, and it can be di
fficult for a beginner to find anything more than basic reference material on using the powerful software suite. In Autotools, autho
r John Calcote begins with an overview of high-level concepts; then tackles more advanced topics, like using the M4 macro processor 
with Autoconf, extending the Automake framework, and building Java and C# sources. You'll learn how to: Master the Autotools build s
ystem to maximize your software's portability Generate Autoconf configuration scripts to simplify the compilation process Produce po
rtable makefiles with Automake Build cross-platform software libraries with Libtool Write your own Autoconf macros Autotools also in
cludes a variety of complete projects that you're encouraged to work through to gain a real-world sense of how to become an Autotool
s practitioner. For example, you'll turn the FLAIM and Jupiter projects' hand-coded, makefile-based build systems into a powerful Au
totools-based build system.}
