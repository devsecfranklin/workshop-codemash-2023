\section{\label{sec:Start}Build a Serverless Github Bot in GCP}
\vspace{2mm}

\justifying
This workshop is meant to be a fun way to learn more about some modern software development technologies. You don't need to have a deep understanding of all parts. Rather, you can follow along from end to end and choose to focus more deeply on any part that holds your attention.

\justifying
A high level overview of the learning path is as follows:

\begin{raggedright}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Review the Python source for the bot.
		\item Configure Google Cloud account, service user, etc.
		\item Set up GitHub with a bot account, dev token, and webhook.
		\item Configure Terraform and deploy the bot.
		\item Test it out.
		\item Explore possibilities for extending the functionality.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{raggedright}

\section{\label{sec:preparation}Preparation}

\justifying
There are some requirements that must be met to successfully complete this workshop.

\section{\label{sec:autotools}GNU Autotools}

\justifying
GNU Autotools have been included in the code base for the workshop. Autotools are a well-maintained set of Open Source tools with a gentle learning curve and are included in the distribution of many Open Source packages that we all rely on daily, at least indirectly, and often unknowingly.

\justifying
The list of tools for using this Autotools configuration paradigm is show in Table \ref{Autotools}.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
		Tool & Description \\\hline
		autoconf & Generates a configure script from configure.ac   \\\hline
		automake & Generates a system-specific Makefile based on Makefile.am template    \\\hline
		make  &   X    \\\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Tools used in this project}
	\label{Autotools}
\end{table}

\justifying
The image shown in Figure \ref{diagram} is from \cite{autobasics}.
It illustrates the relationship between components mentioned in Table \ref{Autotools}.

\section{\label{sec:bot}Bot Setup}

Invite bot user ``bot-account'' as a collaborator on the repo.

\section{\label{sec:Python}Python}

\justifying
The Python code is meant to run as a ``Cloud Function'' in GCP. This is a cost-effective way to run code without deploying cloud infrastructure such as dedicated host instances or other cloud infrastructure that must be maintained. We get to run our code and let Google take care of the rest.
